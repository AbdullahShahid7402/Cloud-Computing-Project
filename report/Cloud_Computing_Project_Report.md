## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
The project aims to develop a cloud-based Task Management System that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks efficiently. The system should be scalable, secure, and accessible from anywhere.

### Objectives
- Develop a full-stack web application using modern technologies
- Implement cloud infrastructure using AWS services
- Ensure secure data storage and transmission
- Provide a responsive and user-friendly interface
- Enable file attachments and task management features

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
